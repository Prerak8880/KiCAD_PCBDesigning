# Arduino Uno CH340

<p>An Arduino Uno CH340 is an Arduino Uno board that uses the CH340 chip as its USB-to-Serial converter. This chip is more cost-effective compared to the Atmega16U2 used in the official Arduino Uno Rev3 boards. The CH340 board is functionally identical to the Uno Rev3, and it can run any Arduino sketch without modification. </p>
